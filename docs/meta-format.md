# The metadata store: file format

Normative. Two implementations exist — `occulited` (Go) and homematic-manager's `local`
provider (TypeScript) — and both run the fixtures in [`occulited/fixtures/`](../fixtures/). Anything not
specified here is undefined and must not be relied on.

## Purpose and scope

Names and taxonomy for Homematic devices and channels. Not values, not paramsets, not a device
registry, not a time series. The store never invents objects: it holds metadata *about*
addresses the interface processes report.

## The file

One JSON document, UTF-8, `meta.json`. The writer replaces it atomically: write to a temporary
file in the same directory, `fsync`, rename over the old file, and keep the previous document as
`meta.json.bak`. A reader that finds `meta.json` unparsable must fall back to `meta.json.bak` and
report that it did, never start empty.

```json
{
  "format": 1,
  "revision": 412,
  "objects": { "<ref>": <object>, ... },
  "enums":   { "<enum-id>": <enum>, ... }
}
```

| Field | Type | Rules |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `format` | integer | `1`. A reader must refuse a higher number. |
| `revision` | integer ≥ 0 | Increases by exactly 1 on every successful write, never decreases, never resets. `0` is an empty store. |
| `objects` | map | Keyed by `ref`. May be empty. |
| `enums` | map | Keyed by enum id. May be empty; a fresh store contains the two defaults below. |

Key order is not significant. Writers should emit keys sorted for stable diffs.

## Refs

A `ref` identifies a device or a channel: `<interface>.<address>`.

- `interface` is the interface's name as the CCU knows it — `BidCos-RF`, `BidCos-Wired`, `HmIP-RF`,
  `VirtualDevices`, `CUxD` — or any user-defined interface name. It never contains `.`.
- `address` is the device serial (`ABC1234567`, `000A1B2C3D4E5F`) or a channel `SERIAL:N`.
- The separator is the first `.`; everything after it is the address.
- Refs are case-sensitive and compared byte-wise.

Examples: `BidCos-RF.JEQ9000001`, `BidCos-RF.JEQ9000001:1`, `HmIP-RF.000A1B2C3D4E5F:4`.

## Objects

```json
{
  "name": "Deckenlampe",
  "enums": ["room/eg/wohnzimmer", "function/licht"],
  "meta": { "ccu-jack": { "hidden": false } },
  "orphaned": true
}
```

| Field | Type | Rules |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `name` | string | Required. Non-empty after trimming; **no control characters** (U+0000–U+001F and U+007F, which includes line breaks and tabs); valid UTF-8; ≤ 255 bytes. A name travels into `meta.json`, through the change stream and into every consumer, and a control character corrupts or truncates something on that way — a NUL most of all, which `utf8.ValidString` accepts. (It also used to travel into an HM-Script export, removed 2026-09-08; the rule stands on its own without it.) |
| `enums` | array of node paths | Optional, default `[]`. Each path must exist. No duplicates. Order not significant. |
| `meta` | object | Optional. One key per consumer namespace (`[a-z0-9][a-z0-9-]*`), any JSON value beneath. The store does not interpret it. ≤ 16 KiB serialised per object. |
| `orphaned` | boolean | Optional, default `false`. Set by the owning process when the address is no longer reported by any interface; cleared when it reappears. Never set by clients. |

An object with a name and nothing else is valid. An entry is never deleted by the store on its own;
`orphaned` is how "gone" is expressed, so that a replaced device keeps its room assignment.

## Enums

An enum is a named taxonomy holding a tree of nodes.

```json
{
  "name": { "de": "Räume", "en": "Rooms" },
  "tree": [
    { "id": "eg", "name": "Erdgeschoss", "children": [
      { "id": "wohnzimmer", "name": "Wohnzimmer", "icon": "sofa" }
    ]},
    { "id": "og", "name": "Obergeschoss" }
  ]
}
```

| Field | Type | Rules |
| --- | --- | --- |
| enum id (the map key) | string | `[a-z0-9][a-z0-9-]*`, ≤ 32 chars. |
| `name` | object | Localised display names, at least `en`; keys are BCP-47 primary tags (`de`, `en`). |
| `tree` | array of nodes | Ordered. Order is display order and is significant. |

### Nodes

| Field | Type | Rules |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `id` | string | `[a-z0-9][a-z0-9-]*`, ≤ 32 chars, **unique among its siblings**. Stable: renaming a node never changes its id. |
| `name` | string | Required, non-empty, ≤ 255 bytes. |
| `icon` | string | Optional, `[a-z0-9-]+`, an icon name the UI maps; unknown names are ignored, not errors. |
| `children` | array of nodes | Optional, default `[]`. Ordered. |

Depth is limited to 8 levels below the enum.

### Paths

A node is addressed by its path: `<enum-id>/<id>/<id>/...`, e.g. `room/eg/wohnzimmer`. An enum
itself is not a valid membership target — an object belongs to nodes, not to enums.

A **subtree query** for `room/eg` returns every object whose `enums` contains `room/eg` or any path
that starts with `room/eg/`. That is the point of the tree: "everything on the ground floor" is one
query.

### The two defaults

A fresh store contains, with empty trees, what a CCU has:

| id | name.de | name.en |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `room` | Räume | Rooms |
| `function` | Gewerke | Functions |

They are ordinary enums: a user may add nodes, rename them, or delete them entirely. Consumers that
map to ReGa's fixed rooms and functions use `room` and `function` and flatten the tree.

A floor needs no taxonomy of its own: it is a room with rooms below it (`room/eg/wohnzimmer`).
Stores created before 2026-09-11 started with a third default, `floor` (Etagen/Floors); they keep
it, the format version did not change, and a consumer must treat enum ids as data.

## Invariants a writer must uphold

1. Every path in any object's `enums` resolves to an existing node.
2. Node ids are unique among siblings; enum ids are unique.
3. `revision` increases by exactly 1 per write, and a write that changes nothing does not happen.
4. The document on disk is always complete and parsable (atomic replace).

## What changes revision

Any successful mutation: object create/update, enum create/update/delete, node create/rename/move/
delete, membership change, an import. Setting `orphaned` by the owning process is a mutation too.
Reads never do.

## YAML

The same document may be exported as YAML and imported from it (`/api/meta/v1/export?format=yaml`,
`PUT /api/meta/v1/import`). YAML is a transport, not the store: an import is validated as a whole,
applied as one revision, and rejected entirely on the first error. Comments do not survive a
round trip and clients must not expect them to.
