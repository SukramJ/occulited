// user before its unit starts. The fork's generated addon units run it through
// /usr/libexec/occu/lite-addon-own as root (ExecStartPre=+-).
//
// It is spelled as a flag on purpose. The fork's half may reach a box before an occulited that has
// the subcommand. An older occulited handed an unknown word would start a second daemon - as root,
// inside the addon's start; handed an unknown flag, Go's flag package refuses it and exits 2 before
// anything else happens, and the wrapper takes exactly that answer as "not supported yet".

// RedMatic changes its directories while it runs, so a Charly boot walked its whole tree anyway, about
// 11 s. Task 110 replaced it with the marker "full walk needed" (system.FullWalkSuffix); one left on a
// box is removed.
