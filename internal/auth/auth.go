// Package auth is occulited's users, tokens and sessions (task 6, D-14, D-28): local accounts
// with argon2id and two roles, API tokens with scopes (task 66, scopes.go), session ids of 130
// bits (26 characters of base32, task 125), failed-login lockout, a first-boot setup, and a
// session directory on tmpfs that the lighttpd gate reads.
//
// Sessions survive a restart and a reboot (B-102, D-67): the store keeps each one under the
// sha256 of its id, never the id itself - in memory, in the session store on the userfs (a
// directory of its own with .nobackup, so no backup carries it) and in the gate's mirror on tmpfs,
// whose files are named by that hash. Whoever holds an id hashes it to look it up.
//
// The legacy alias (task 125, D-77): the CCU's addon convention passes the session as
// `?sid=@xxxxxxxxxx@`, ten alphanumerics, and the addons' CGIs parse exactly that shape. A session
// gets such an alias only when the shell opens an addon that needs it (LegacyID), one per session,
// drawn without bias. The alias is accepted by lighttpd's gate and the tclrega shim for /addons/
// alone - never by the API, never as a cookie - and ends with its session. Its mirror is a second
// directory, named by the alias's hash like the session's; the alias itself the process keeps in
// memory only, so that it can hand it out again, and a restart forgets it (a restored session's
// alias keeps working at the gate until the shell asks for a new one).
