// The start order of an addon (task 94, section 6, optimisation 1). An addon's manifest
// may say which interface processes it talks to, runtime.needs; occulited writes that as one line
// to /usr/local/etc/config/addon-policy/<id>.needs, and the fork's occu-addons generator reads
// the file at the next boot and orders addon-<id>.service after exactly those units:
//
//	(no file)             undeclared - after rfd and hmipserver, as every addon started before
//	none                  needs no interface - right after the network (a broker, a web page)
//	rfd hmipserver        after the named units only
//
// The file is independent of the confinement mode: a root addon is ordered like a confined one.
// Undeclared stays the safe default, and so does anything occulited cannot vouch for: an id it
// does not know makes the whole declaration unusable (logged), because ordering an addon after
// less than it needs brings back the RPC errors at boot the default exists to avoid.
