// Task 107 (RedMatic bug 10): a confined addon's files are given back to its user before every start
// of its unit, not only after an install through occulited. RedMatic's update script copies the new
// package as root with `cp -af` and then starts the unit itself; var/ is root's at that moment, the
// start as addon-redmatic fails on its start lock, and B-92's repair comes only after the installer.
// The fork's occu-addons generator gives every confined addon unit
//
//	ExecStartPre=+-/usr/libexec/occu/lite-addon-own <id>
//
// and that wrapper runs `occulited -addon-own <id>` as root (the "+"), which walks exactly the
// directories below (AddonOwnPlan) with ownwalk. Whoever starts the unit - an update script, the
// wrapper, occulited, the Services page, the boot - the files are the addon's first.
//
// Task 110 (the maintainer, 2026-09-13: "Full walk after install only"): root writes into a confined
// addon's tree when the addon is installed, updated or switched to its own user, and the whole walk
// cost RedMatic about 11 s at every Charly boot. So the whole tree is walked only after such a change,
// which leaves the marker below: at the next start of the unit, and in B-92's look while the marker is
// there. Every other start and look takes the quick check (ownwalk.QuickDepth: the top directories
// and their direct entries), and a wrong owner it finds brings the whole walk after all. Fix
// ownership always walks the whole tree.

// FullWalkSuffix names the marker "full walk needed", <id>.fullwalk beside the addon's policy. The
// directory is root's and the daemon writes into it through the helper: the addon's user can neither
// create nor remove the marker, and no walk and no data directory ever gives that directory to an
// addon. What it holds (the reason) is for a reader on the box; that it is there is what counts.
