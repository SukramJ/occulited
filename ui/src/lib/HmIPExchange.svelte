    /*
     * The radio-exchange diagnosis (task 155, D-106): HmIP-RF stopped because eQ-3's key server
     * rejected the move of this system's HmIP network to the module in use. One log line, two
     * causes, told apart by hmipserver's own output (the system probes nothing):
     *   - the key server was never reached: a network or DNS matter; the page offers a retry, which
     *     restarts HmIP-RF - the move is tried at every start;
     *   - the key server answered and refused this module: the network cannot move to it, whatever
     *     the network connection does, and the server does not say why (openccu-lite task 301: no
     *     claim about its rules - it may refuse a module it knows). The page names the ways out -
     *     the module the network is on now, the saved files of an earlier module (a snapshot, a
     *     backup; no key server needed), or the guided fresh start: the previous module's identity
     *     is moved aside and kept, local key mode can be switched on in the same step, then HmIP-RF
     *     starts with an empty network and every HmIP device is paired again. Administrators only,
     *     confirmed by typing the system's host name (the factory reset's shape).
     * The local record of exchanges (task 301) is listed, and it names the one cause the system can
     * see: the previous module took the network over without the key server (a local swap onto a
     * module whose firmware cannot take the network key, B-289), so no exchange away from it works.
     * A marker written before the causes existed has neither and gets the sentence that names both.
